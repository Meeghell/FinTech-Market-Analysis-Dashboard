## Project Proposal Guideline

Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).

Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).

* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data.

* Possible source for such data.

This constitutes your Project Proposal and Outline, here is an example:

> Our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We'll examine relationships between types of transactions and location; purchase prices and times of day; trends in purchases over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits. && The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over the course of a year, and other related relationships that will derive from the data.
